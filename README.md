# Intro_MachineLearning
Slides and Notebooks based on a series of Lectures I gave in 2016 at AIMS Senegal

The folder will be updated within the next month to cover several basic concepts and algorithms of the Machine Learning field.
Most lecture have a corresponding jupyter notebook (Python3) illustrating the contents.
