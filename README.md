# Intro_MachineLearning
Slides and Notebooks based on a series of Lectures I gave in 2016 at AIMS Senegal titled "Introduction to Big Data and Machine Learning."
It is a gentle introduction to the world of machine learning focusing first on simple classification to move to more advanced topics trying to cover essential knwoledge in the field.

I am considering this as a long term project getting better with time...
If it looks a bit short at the moment it's normal, the folder will be updated regularly (hopefully) to cover several basic concepts and algorithms of the Machine Learning field.
Most lecture have a corresponding jupyter notebook (Python3) illustrating the contents.

## Requirements

If you want to fully enjoy the notebooks make sure all requirements are installed by running :
```sh
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
